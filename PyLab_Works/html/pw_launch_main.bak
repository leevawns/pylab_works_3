<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts8>October 2008</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts1>PyLab Works Launch Center</span></p>
<p>With the Launch Center all major applications within the PyLab Works frame can be started. At this moment not all parts are fully functional, but at least they will give you a fair idea of the functionality of PyLab_Works.</p>
<p><span class=rvts10>Main: </span>this is the major page where all programs can be launched. At this moment the Library manager contains a better IDE than the IDE itself, that's because I use the Launch Center myself as a coding and testing tool.</p>
<p><span class=rvts10>Demos: </span>This page contains full working demos of PyLab Works applications and it will gradual grow in time. All demo-projects can be run in application mode and in design mode, in the latter you can modify the design ( the original demo can always be recovered)</p>
<p><span class=rvts10>Test:</span> Don't dare to look at that page, it's mainly meant for core developers, but it might be also useful to track down installation problems on different Operating Systems.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>PyLab Works</span> : The main application, this should work pretty well, still it's strongly recommended to start with the demos.</p>
<p><span class=rvts10>IDE</span> : A simple editor / IDE to edit and test general Python programs. This is a very premature version, just meant for my own to run tests. The Library manager already contains a more mature version of the IDE.</p>
<p><span class=rvts10>Library Manager</span> : Manage PyLab_Works libraries, download / upgrade from the web. Work in progress, but might give you a good idea of the future version. As already said, this library manager contains a more mature version of the IDE.</p>
<p><span class=rvts10>Translation Tool</span> : A tool to edit and upload translations of PyLab_Works libraries.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each of the above modules can be started with a number of <span class=rvts10>CommandLine Flags</span> (always lowercase), shown on the lower-left corner:</p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li>debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = print extra debug information </li>
<li>debugfile = print and append to file ( &lt;application&gt;_debug.txt ) extra debug information </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts2>ToDo</span></p>
<p>This is not the complete todo list, just the part that came up during the preparation of this first alfa release and couldn't be fixed on the flight..</p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li>dialogs, multi-language, AFAIK this must be done to create our own dialogs. The source code is concentrated in dialog_support. </li>
<li>made a change in language_support, can't imagine it has ever worked ??? FINDING THE CORRECT LANGUAGE FILE </li>
<li>IDE extend with autocreate "__init__.py" if new directory, "main" expansion </li>
<li>language dialog with flags dimmed if language not available </li>
<li>wxp-widgets don't work in Ubuntu </li>
<li>IDE extend with OS-dependancies </li>
<li>open (... "wb")&nbsp; gives warning / error in Ubuntu ??? </li>
<li>list click in Ubuntu doesn't work very well </li>
<li>** (python:10896): WARNING **: Can't create printer "PDF" because the id "PDF" is already used&nbsp; // (python:10896): GnomePrintCupsPlugin-WARNING **: The CUPS printer PDF could not be created //(python:10896): GnomePrintCupsPlugin-WARNING **: The data for the CUPS printer PDF could not be loaded. </li>
<li>regular expression calculator</li>
<li>print selected</li>
