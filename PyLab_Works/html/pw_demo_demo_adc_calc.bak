<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This demo shows a real-time data-acquistion, with real-time (chunk) analysis. Because this program uses a windows executable to perform the data-acquisition, it doesn't yet work on Linux. I hope someone is able to write a platform independent DAQmx driver, then we all can see this demo and more. In this case you don't need the desired hardware, because the data-acquisition is set to file-mode, in which case already recorded data is play backed.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The recorded signals shown are the green: the electrical activity of the heart (Electro-CardioGram / ECG), blue: the interarterial bloodpressure.</p>
<p>The red signal is a calculated signal, the systolic pressure, which is the maximum of the bloodpressure.</p>
<p>The recording contains a number of other signals, which are not very interesting, if you're not familiar with the setup of the measurement. There are also many calculated signals, all derived from the bloodpressure, which might be interesting to view.</p>
